# JAVA-PROJECT

The provided code is an implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface. It creates a window with a 3x3 grid of buttons representing the game board. Two players, X and O, take turns clicking on the buttons to make their moves.The game keeps track of the score for each player and the number of rounds played. After each move, the code checks for a winning condition by examining the rows, columns, and diagonals of the game board. If a player wins or if all buttons are filled without a winner, a result message is displayed.The code includes additional features such as a game name label, a scoreboard displaying the scores for X and O, and the ability to play multiple rounds. After three rounds, a game end message is shown, declaring the winner based on the highest score, or indicating a draw if the scores are tied.The implementation follows object-oriented principles, with the TicTacToe class extending JFrame and implementing the ActionListener interface to handle button clicks. The main method creates an instance of the TicTacToe class to start the game.Overall, this code provides a basic structure for a playable Tic Tac Toe game with multiple rounds and score tracking.
